# NYC-Traffic-Safety
Exploring Street Safety in New York City

NYU CUSP Team: Michael Carper, Kelsey Nanan, Aleka Raju

This repository contains the code I, Michael Carper, wrote and the analyses I performed as a contribution to this term project for our Applied Data Science course with Associate Professor Stanislav Sobolevsky.

The analyses included here are time series forecasting analyses predicting New York City traffic injuries and deaths by borough over the next four years based on historical NYPD collision data. This analysis was performed with the intention of evaluating Vision Zero NYC's progress toward its goal of zero traffic injuries or fatalities by 2024.
