# NYC-Traffic-Safety
Exploring Street Safety in New York City

NYU CUSP Team: Michael Carper, Kelsey Nanan, Aleka Raju

This repository contains the code I, Michael Carper, wrote and the analyses I performed as a contribution to this Applied Data Science term project. This course was led by Associate Professor Stanislav Sobolevsky.

Included here are three time series forecasting analyses predicting New York City traffic injuries and deaths by borough over the next four years based on historical NYPD collision data. One analysis was performed on overall traffic injury and death totals, one was performed on a population-normalized version of these totals and the third was performed on cyclist and pedestrians injuries and fatalities only. This analysis was performed with the intention of evaluating Vision Zero NYC's progress toward its goal of zero traffic injuries or fatalities by 2024.
