# NYC-Traffic-Safety
Exploring Street Safety in New York City

NYU CUSP Team: Michael Carper, Kelsey Nanan, Aleka Raju

This repository contains the code I, Michael Carper, wrote and the analyses I performed as a contribution to this Applied Data Science term project. This course was led by Associate Professor Stanislav Sobolevsky.

Included here are three time series forecasting analyses predicting New York City traffic injuries and deaths by borough over the next four years based on historical NYPD collision data. The first analysis is on overall traffic injury and death totals, the second is cyclist and pedestrian injuries and fatalities only, and the third is a population-normalized version of the first. These analyses were performed with the intention of evaluating Vision Zero NYC's progress toward its goal of zero traffic injuries or fatalities by 2024.
